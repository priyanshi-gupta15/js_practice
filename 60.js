// que => Private Variables with Closures: Create a function counter that returns an object with two methods: increment and getCount. Use a closure to keep a private count variable thatâ€™s only accessible to these methods. Test the counter to ensure count is private.

function counter()
{
    return {
        function increment(){
            

        }
        function getCount(){

        }
    }
}
